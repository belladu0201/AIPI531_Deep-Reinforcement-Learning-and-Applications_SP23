## Course Description
Deep Reinforcement Learning Applications will cover advanced sequential decision-making topics in AI and will consist of two parts 1) deep reinforcement learning theory and 2) deep reinforcement learning applications. The theory module will introduce students to major deep reinforcement learning algorithms, modeling process, and programming. The applications module will include case studies on the practical applications of deep reinforcement learning in industry. This is a project-based course with extensive Pytorch/Tensorflow hands-on exercises.
